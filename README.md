## 🎼 Abstract

This repository contains the interactive web presentation of my PhD thesis exploring the cutting-edge field of **Robotic Musicianship**. The research focuses on developing machine intelligence through algorithms and cognitive models to capture musical perception, composition, and performance capabilities, enabling robots to participate in cooperative musical ensembles with humans.

The core innovation lies in addressing the challenge of **real-time synchronization** in human-robot musical collaborations, where human performers naturally express with the 'feel' of music and leadership roles change fluidly within the ensemble.

### 🔬 Research Innovation

**Dual Strategy Approach:**
- **🎵 Mapping Phase:** Control and sensing of musical instrument components with sound synthesis parameters
- **🤖 Modeling Phase:** Deep learning models to capture overall musical process representation

**Mathematical Foundation:**
Each musician (human or robot) is modeled as a separate oscillator using the **Kuramoto synchronization algorithm**, combined with **LSTM neural networks** for predictive musical modeling.
